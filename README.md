# AI Game Designer

This project uses AI to generate Game Design Documents (GDDs) based on user input. It leverages the OpenAI API and a series of AI agents to iterate on game ideas and produce comprehensive GDDs.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Run `npm start` to start the server

## Usage

Open `frontend.js` in a web browser to interact with the AI Game Designer.
